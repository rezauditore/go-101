# Go 101

This repository provides beginner-friendly examples to learn and explore Go.

## Examples

### 1. generics/custom_map
A generic implementation of a custom map that can store key-value pairs with flexible types.

### 2. generics/pizza
The Pizza example demonstrates the power of Go generics by modeling a flexible Pizza type, showcasing how generics make your code reusable and adaptable to real-world scenarios.
#### Features
##### 1. Generic Ingredients:
    The Pizza type uses a generic parameter T, allowing the Ingredients list to handle any data type. For example:
        Use simple types like strings ("Tomato", "Cheese").
        Use complex types like structs containing metadata (e.g., weight, nutritional info).

##### 2. Customizable Details:
    Each pizza has:
        Name: The name of the pizza (e.g., "Margherita", "Pepperoni").
        Ingredients: A list of ingredients.
        Price: The cost of the pizza.
